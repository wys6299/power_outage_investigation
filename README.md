# Proejct Overview 

This is a data science project investigating the relationship of the values in a power outage dataset, then discussing a question with the assessment of missingness, and dealing with a hypothesis test. This project is for DSC80 at UCSD.

# Investigating Research Question and Introduction 
The content of the dataset is about the major power outages that happened in different states in the continental U.S. during January 2000 - July 2016. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of variables, including major outage data, geographical locations of the outages, date and time information, regional climatic details, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, and economic attributes of the affected states. This rich repository of information serves as a valuable resource for analyzing historical trends and patterns associated with major power outages. **To find out what Characteristics are associated with each category of cause, we will investigate the correlation between category and other values recorded in the dataset.**

## Introduction to the Datasets in this Study
The dataset we are using contains the information on 1534 power outages cases from 2000 to 2016, with 59 columns recording the information. Based on the question we investigate, the columns are useful for us to use with the description as follow:
